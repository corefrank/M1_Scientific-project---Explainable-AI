## Project Objectives

1. CIFAR 10 Dataset

2. optimize CNN hyperparameters, Train CNN and provide performance, brief error analysis

3. Perform 2 XAI techniques: DeepSHAP and Layerwise Relevance Propagation

4. Provide metrics to compare the quality of the XAI techniques


### Notice:
Please open at unrestricted Mode, in that case the code can show all the output. ALL code output(the picture, the data) is attached in the jupyter notebook.

When opened, it should be in color. If there is no colored title, it is likely still in restricted mode, which means you probably won't be able to view the code output images either. If you are using a compiler like VSCode, it is recommended to first exit restricted mode, then close the code in VSCode, and reopen it.
